                        Ever since my first year in honors, I had a dream of becoming a programmer.
                        Unfortunately, due to financial struggles, I couldnâ€™t buy a PC. However, I never gave up on my aspirations.
                        In my third year (2023), I started offering private tuition to save money. By June 2024, I stopped teaching and
                        used my savings to buy a PC, marking the beginning of my programming journey.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I am passionate about becoming a helpful person not only in programming but also in life. One of my biggest dreams
                        is to succeed and inspire underprivileged individuals to achieve their goals.
